This project delves into house price prediction using real estate data. It showcases my proficiency in data analysis and machine learning techniques gained through college coursework.

Key Steps:

Data Acquisition & Cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering
Model Building & Evaluation


Key Takeaways:

Enhanced Data Science Skills: This project fostered a deeper understanding of the data science workflow, encompassing data acquisition, cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

Data Analysis Expertise: I honed my proficiency in data cleaning techniques to handle missing values and outliers. Additionally, I explored feature selection and the relationships between features and the target variable through correlation analysis and visualizations.

Machine Learning Exploration: This project provided an opportunity to experiment with various machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression). I gained insights into model selection, hyperparameter tuning (using GridSearchCV for Ridge Regression), and model evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R-squared, Adjusted R-squared).
